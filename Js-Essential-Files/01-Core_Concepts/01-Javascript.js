JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language mainly used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It runs directly in the browser but can also run on servers using environments like Node.js.

* It is lightweight, flexible, and supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming styles.

* Together with HTML (structure) and CSS (styling), JavaScript forms the core technology of the web. */
